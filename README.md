# Movies Backend Server

This is a small Server doing all of the backend Work for our Movies App. It provides a simple REST-API for our app to have a cloud experience.

It's written in NodeJS and all the Logic is in runserver.js (for now). It connects to our Database (MongoDB) and this project is already configured for automatic deployment with Heroku for changes in Master.

The API can be accesed from:

The Documentation for the API is available here:
