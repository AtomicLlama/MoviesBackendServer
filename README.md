# Movies Backend Server

This is a small Server doing all of the backend Work for our Movies App. It provides a simple REST-API for our app to have a cloud experience.

It's written in NodeJS and Aeolus (our own Framework for fast REST API Building on the fly). It connects to our Database (MongoDB) and this project is already configured for automatic deployment with Heroku for changes in Master.

***Disclaimer: This Server is not an imdb copy. It doesn't store any actual movie information at all. It is all handled by http://themoviedb.org***

The API can be accesed from:

The Documentation for the API is available here:
